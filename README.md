# Creating a simple recommendation system in Python using Pandas

This is a simple Python movie recommendation system that uses correlation between ratings assigned to different movies to find similarities between movies.

## Types of recommendation systems
- Content filtering
- Collaborative filtering

## Content filtering
In content filtering, the similarity between different products is calculated based on the attributes of the products. For example, in a content-based recommendation film system, the similarity between films is calculated based on genres, actors in the film, the director of the film, etc.

## Collaborative filtering
Collaborative filtering uses the power of the crowd. The intuition behind collaborative filtering is that if user A likes products X and Y, and another user B likes product X, then there is a high probability that he will like product Y.

For example, the movie recommendation system. Suppose a huge number of users assigned the same ratings to films X and Y. A new user arrives who has assigned the same rating to the movie X, but has not yet watched the movie Y. The collaborative filtration system will recommend the film Y.
